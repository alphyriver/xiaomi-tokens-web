- 🌐 Multi-region server support with auto-discovery
- ⚡ Edge-ready deployment with Hono.js

## Important Notice

⚠️ **Privacy Warning**: The hosted version processes your credentials through a third-party server. For maximum privacy and security, it is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** to deploy your own instance.

## Quick Start

### Deploy Your Own (Recommended)

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/alphyriver/xiaomi-tokens-web)

### Use the Hosted Version (Use at Your Own Risk)
Visit [https://xiaomi-token-web.asd.workers.dev/](https://xiaomi-token-web.asd.workers.dev/) - Not recommended for privacy-sensitive users.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Local development
```bash
# Run with tsx (Node.js)
npm run serve

# Run with Wrangler (Cloudflare Workers emulation)
npm run dev

# Enable debug logging (sensitive data is automatically sanitized)
DEBUG=true npm run serve
# or
DEBUG=1 npm run dev
```

## Deployment Options

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
1. Go to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Create a new project and select this repository
4. Use these build settings:
   - Framework preset: `None`
   - Build command: `npm run build:pages`
   - Build output directory: `dist`

`wrangler.toml` sets `pages_build_output_dir`, so once the project is
connected the output directory is read from the repository and the
dashboard field can be left alone.

The static page is served from `dist/`, and every `/api/*` request is
handled by `functions/api/[[route]].ts`, which mounts the same Hono app
used by the Workers deployment. Run `npm run dev:pages` to serve both
together locally.

### Deploy to other platforms
The app is built with Hono.js which supports multiple platforms. Check [Hono's documentation](https://hono.dev/) for platform-specific deployment guides.

## Usage Guide

1. **Login**
   - Enter your Xiaomi account credentials (email, phone, or Xiaomi ID)
   - Select your server region (or let auto-discovery find your devices)
   - Click Login

2. **Two-Factor Authentication (if enabled)**
   - Open the provided URL in a browser
   - Request a verification code via SMS or email
   - **Important**: DO NOT complete verification on Xiaomi's website
   - Enter the 6-digit code in the web interface

3. **View Devices**
   - After successful login, your devices will be displayed
   - Click on any value to copy it to clipboard
   - Switch regions using the dropdown if needed

4. **Session Management**
   - Save your session for future use (avoids repeated login)
   - Load previously saved sessions
   - Sessions are compatible with the Python version
